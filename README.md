# NLP Algorithms in Python

This repository focuses on learning core concepts related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) through practical implementations of various algorithms and techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Text Preprocessing Techniques

#### 1. **Tokenization**
- Breaking text into individual words, phrases, or sentences
- Implementation of different tokenization strategies
- Handling special characters and punctuation

#### 2. **Lemmatization**
- Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma)
- Converting words like "running" → "run", "better" → "good"
- Preserving semantic meaning while reducing vocabulary size

#### 3. **Stemming**
- Removing prefixes and suffixes to get the root form
- Converting words like "running" → "run", "happiness" → "happi"
- Faster but less accurate than lemmatization

#### 4. **Stop Words Removal**
- Filtering out common words that don't add semantic value
- Removing words like "the", "is", "at", "which", "on"
- Improving text analysis efficiency

### Text Representation Techniques

#### 5. **Bag of Words (BoW)**
- Simple text representation as word frequency vectors
- Creating document-term matrices
- Basic approach for text classification and analysis

#### 6. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Advanced text representation considering word importance
- Balancing word frequency with document rarity
- Better than BoW for most NLP tasks

#### 7. **N-grams (Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams)**
- Creating word sequences of different lengths
- Capturing local word order and context
- Unigrams: single words, Bigrams: word pairs, etc.

### Word Embeddings

#### 8. **Word2Vec**
- Neural network-based word embeddings
- Learning distributed representations of words
- Capturing semantic relationships between words

#### 9. **Average Word2Vec**
- Document-level embeddings by averaging word vectors
- Converting variable-length texts to fixed-length vectors
- Useful for document classification and similarity
